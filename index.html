                    <h3>Arran</h3>
                    <p>The Isle of Arran is often described as Scotland in miniature. Home to around 4,000 people, Arran has an overwhelming amount of activities, scenery and wildlife to experience, all within a two-hour journey from Glasgow.</p>

                    <h3>Bute</h3>
                    <p>The Isle of Bute has long been established as a day trip destination for Glasgow folk travelling on steamers along the Clyde. Rothesay has a Victorian elegance to it, which makes for a nostalgic trip back in time.</p>

                <div class="column1of3">
                    <h3>Islay</h3>
                    <p>Islay is fondly known as the 'Queen of the Hebrides' and is widely regarded as the spiritual home of whiskey. Islay boasts white-sand beaches, unique birdlife and a rugged coastline.</p>

                    <h3>Jura</h3>
                    <p>The Isle of Jura lies very close to Islay, with a population of 200 that is vastly outnumbered by 6,000 red deer. Jura is rugged and dominated by three great cones, known as the Paps.</p>

                    <h3>Colonsay</h3>
                    <p>Colonsay is small enough to be explored by bike and on foot, yet large enough to keep you busy for at least a week. The island has spectacular beaches, rugged miniature hills and a vibrant community.</p>

                    <h3>Mull</h3>
                    <p>The Isle of Mull is the second largest of the Inner Hebrides after Skye. There is a long and hearty list of all the things you can do, including climbing Ben More, the only island Munro, standing at 966 metres above sea level.</p>

                    <h3>Iona</h3>
                    <p>Iona holds a special place in the hearts of many Scots, known as the cradle of Christianity in Scotland, where the original monastery was founded in the sixth century by St Columba, a monk who had been exiled from Ireland.</p>

                <div class="column1of3">
                    <h3>Coll</h3>
                    <p>Coll is a neighbor of Tiree, both similar in size, but Coll is far more wild and rugged in its character. The island is surrounded by stunning white-shell sands. Coll was the first island to be awarded Dark Sky status, observing the bright stars on any given night is a truly spectacular experience.</p>

                    <h3>Tiree</h3>
                    <p>Tiree is the most westerly of the Inner Hebrides and renowned for its long hours of sunshine in the spring and early summer. There is a healthy population of 650 people, many of whom live in white-washed cottages with tall, hipped roofs. Tiree has become the centre of windsurfing, due to its flat landscape.</p>

                    <h3>Rum</h3>
                    <p>Rum is the largest of the Small Isles and magnificently wild and rugged, dominated by the jagged mountains of the dark volcanic rock peaks of the Cuillin ridge. For a period it was known as 'the Forbidden Isle' as visitors were discouraged, but now it is owned by the local community.</p>

                    <p>The best known of all the Scottish islands, Skye is a mystical place with dramatic landscapes. The Skye bridge has connected the island to the mainland since 1995 and there is a huge range of activities to do.</p>

                    <p>Raasay is the largest of the islands off the coastline of Skye, and it is a real gem. Almost twenty kilometres long, its landscape is dominated by the flat-topped volcanic summit of Dun Caan, reaching 444 metres.</p>
